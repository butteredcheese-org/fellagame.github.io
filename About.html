            <h1 class="text-center">Fella</h1>
            <p class="text-center">A first-person tycoon-style game with a criminal twist and a dose of humor.</p>
            <p class="text-center">In Fella, you play as a drug dealer named Fella who can grow and cook marijuana, meth, and psychedelics to sell to low-level street junkies. The game has a variety of interesting mechanics, including a chance of getting raided by police or homeless people if you leave your door unlocked, a minigame to fill up your RV's gas tank, and the ability to tip pizza delivery guys with an epic tip.</p>
            <p class="text-center">As you progress, you can purchase guns and alcohol from a store called "America R Us" and steal/hotwire cars once you reach level 5. You can also buy a second property in the form of an RV, which you can drive anywhere, and recruit low-level gang members to cook for you while you are away. The game also has a multiplayer mode featuring characters of different races.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Overall, Fella may appeal to players who enjoy tycoon-style games with a criminal twist and a dose of humor. The game's unique mechanics and irreverent tone may provide an entertaining experience for those looking for something different.</p>
